**This article is to help assist in checking basic network connectivity issues using Powershell cmdlets. We'll show you some basic network troubleshooting tools for checking network connectivity and configuration.**

### Prerequisites
Windows&reg; Powershell 

### Prowershell Syntax

A quick note on Powershell Cmdlets syntax to understand user expectations for the cmdlet.

1. Powershell is not case sensitive.
2. Cmdlets always use a Verb-Noun structure. This is helpful with understanding the function of a given command.
3. Cmdlets output can be modified with parameters.
4. Parameter names always start with a dash like -name, -object, -list
5. "**Get-Help** "***Command Name***" *-Full*" - Will return help for command usage.
